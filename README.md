**BASIC IDEA**
Users (addresses) can come together to create a private prediction market to bet on the outcome of events (for eg price of ETH in USD after 5 days),the protocol deposits the amounts staked by all participants into bentobox to earn interest, then the  protocol will check the price/event outcome after the stipulated time using Chainlink Alarms and Chainlink http calls, withdraw funds + interest from bentobox, distribute the original funds amongst the winners using Superfluid Instant Distribution Agreements and using the interest, create a stream into the Ricochet Exchange to DCA buy & burn KLIMA tokens. These KLIMA tokens represent carbon offsets which the protocol helps remove from the market thereby increasing the cost of carbon offsets( which in turn increases the cost of pollution). The IDA index used to distribute funds can be reused for another prediction between the same participants.
